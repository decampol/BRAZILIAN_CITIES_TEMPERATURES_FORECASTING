# BRAZILIAN_CITIES_TEMPERATURES_FORECASTING

## Description : 

  This small project aims at offer a possible way of forecasting the temperatures of several cities in Brazil, and thus for three years (from beginning 2017 to end 2019). It leans on raw data sets my collegue and I found on Kaggle at this link :

  Our project comes in the form of a jupyter notebook.
  
## Running : 

  In order to run our project, please make sure to download the notebook as well as the file "data", and replace the path in the code by your actual one.
  
  Enjoy !
